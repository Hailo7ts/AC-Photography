## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The web development project involved building a fully responsive website for a local photographer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML was employed to structure the website's content, including sections for the artist's portfolio and contact information. CSS was used to design and style the site, ensuring it was visually appealing and responsive across various devices by using media queries and flexible layouts. JavaScript was incorporated to add interactivity, such as image sliders, enhancing the user experience and facilitating easy navigation for potential clients seeking to view or commission work.

## Lessons Learned:

Importance of Responsive Design: Ensuring the website was fully responsive highlighted the need to rigorously test across different devices and screen sizes. It reinforced the value of using CSS techniques like media queries and flexible layouts to create a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms.

Testing and Debugging: The project revealed the significance of thorough testing and debugging. Testing the siteâ€™s responsiveness, interactivity, and overall performance across various environments helped identify and resolve issues early, ensuring a smoother launch.
